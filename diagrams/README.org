* Instructions to setup the DB
For this website the data is stored with MariaDB, all syntax related to the data is compatible with any MYSQL database as well though.
** Through a CLI
Since the steps to dowload the db may differ based on OS that will be left to the user to do.
- Once installed download the sql scripts
- to execute a command use ~\.~
- so to execute a given script: ~\. <path to script file>~
- only needs to execute the ~create_data.sql~ script if you plan to manually enter other stuff
- run the ~insert_dummy_data.sql~ script if you wish to test the features immediately.
